# Irish-Wind-Market-Electricity-Price-Prediction-using-by-Time-Series-Data
Applied cutting-edge machine learning techniques and feature engineering to predict Irish electricityprices for the pre-COVID-19 period (2018-2020). 
Achieved a remarkable error rate reduction of 3-5%, resulting inthe creation of a comprehensive thesis.


Electricity plays a crucial and mundane role in modern life. It is the most critical and relied-upon facility, and its usage and related systems are paramount. 
It is impossible to avoid using electricity on a typical day, from turning on the lights in the morning to turning them off at night. 
At the same time, electricity prices are getting higher daily, and there are reasons behind that. Still, the last person who reaches the processed electricity is just a consumer,
and it is expected that they may be aware of the reason for inclined electricity prices. One reason is that electricity is now being transferred from people or
corporations to the end consumer, allowing for the trade, sale, and purchase of electricity, ultimately making it a tradable commodity. In Ireland, 
electricity is traded in The Single Electricity Market (SEM), where suppliers and generators exchange power and do business across Ireland. 
It is integrated with European electricity markets and enables people to use commodities where it is needed. In the electricity markets,
one of the most critical roles played by “electricity price forecasting,” this paper mainly focuses on 
“Day-ahead Electricity Price Forecasting on Irish Wind Market using Time Series Models.”
It is common for electricity generators and companies to use data-driven electricity price forecast models. 
And this paper targets and orients in electricity price prediction with machine learning algorithms such as mainly LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory),
SVR (Support Vector Regression), RF (Random Forest), GB (Gradient Boosting), and their broadened comparison. 
The approaches and results are observed, analyzed, and the simulation sessions advised demonstrated that LSTM has the most effective, impressive outcomes.
